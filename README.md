Project Overview
Sports Basics is a newly established sports blog company aiming to increase website traffic by releasing a special edition magazine on IPL 2024.

The magazine will provide engaging insights and facts tailored for fans, analysts, and teams, utilizing data from the last three IPL seasons.

Using Power BI, I have analyzed the past three years of IPL data to uncover key insights for both primary and secondary analysis.
